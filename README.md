# Automorphic
100000000 (10^8) digits automorphic number

The large number X in `result` (base-10 with reversed order i.e. from lowest digit to highest digit)
is a automorphic number (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automorphic_number)

Check it with `check.py` (with enough memory like 16GB?). `numpy` is needed. If you want to use `NTT`,
`sympy` is needed (much slower than `FFT`)
